/*
Task: create a program that will help a farmer maintain his inventory. Find all the green apples and find all the apples that are heavier than 200g

        create a class Apple
        create instance variables color and weight
        create a constructor to initialize the variables
        encapsulate and override toString

        create an interface ApplePredicate
        create an abstract method test()
            parameter: Apple
            return: boolean

        create a class AppleGreenColorPredicate
        implement the ApplePredicate
        implement test method to check for green color apples

        create a class AppleHeavyPredicate
        implement the ApplePredicate
        implement test method to check for apples more than 200g

        create a runner class
        create an ArrayList of Apples
        create a method to filter the apples based on a ApplePredicate argument
            parameter: List<Apple>, ApplePredicate
            return: List<Apple>
